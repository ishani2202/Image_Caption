## 📝 Overview
The Image Caption Generator leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract features from images and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers to generate descriptive text. This combination allows the model to understand visual content and articulate descriptions in natural language.

## 🌟 Project Highlights
- **Image Feature Extraction**: Uses CNNs (e.g., InceptionV3) to extract features from images.
- **Text Generation**: LSTM layers generate captions based on visual context, producing coherent and meaningful descriptions.
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Integrated pipeline from image input to caption output.
- **Dataset Support**: Compatible with MS COCO and other custom datasets for image-caption pairs.

## 🏗️ Architecture
The model architecture consists of:
1. **CNN Encoder**: Pretrained CNN model (e.g., InceptionV3) to encode images into a feature vector.
2. **RNN Decoder**: LSTM layers process feature vectors and generate captions word-by-word.
3. **Embedding Layer**: Maps words to vector representations, improving language modeling.
